Born in Palo Alto, California, David's birth coincided with the only known intervention in the Californian sky of 999 bald eagles in perfect formation swooping over the peaks of the Bay. It is said that David's first cry as a baby synchronized with the glorious squawk of the entire flock at once. When David looked up at his parents, they had to avert their gaze due to the sheer strength of his eye contact. David insisted he drive himself back home, and knew the way. </p>  
<p>
In retrospect, there were already omens and portents. The solar panels John Warren had installed on the roof quadrupled their output whenever David smiled at them. Curiosity the cat bowed reverently whenever he stepped into the room. When David stabbed his sister in the face, many things could be said, but nothing against his accuracy or mastery of the blade. 
</p> 
<p> When John Warren wheeled back on his steps after forgetting his newborn baby at a construction site, he came back and beheld 2318, fully built. To this day, rumor is some worker gave newborn David a screwdriver. David's towering heights made everyone feel like a little schmuck at school. Mark Credey used a seismograph to avoid getting crushed. </p>
